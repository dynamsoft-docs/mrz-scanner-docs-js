# MRZ Scanner JavaScript Edition - Demo

Using the Hello World implementation as a reference, the Demo code offers a bit more colour and styling to the MRZ Scanner implementation.

## Code

The full code of the demo can be found [**here**](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/mrz-scanner-javascript/blob/main/samples/demo/index.html).

Please note that this code uses the library via local sources, meaning that the library is built from the source files that are in the same repo.

In order to run the app, all you need to do is this:

1. Download/Clone the repository via Github

2. Execute the `npm run build` command in the terminal (or Powershell)

3. Execute the `npm run serve` command

After that, you should get a couple of URLs, one for the Hello World sample and one for the Demo sample.

## Conclusion

If you do not wish to build the library from the source files, you can change the script reference at the `<head>` of the code to the CDN link. To learn more about the ways you can include the library, please visit [User Guide - Quick Start]({{ site.guides }}mrz-scanner.html#quick-start---hello-world).
