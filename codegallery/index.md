# MRZ Scanner JavaScript Edition - Code Gallery

In the user guide, we helped walk you through the Hello World implementation which is the most basic implementation that uses the default UI of the MRZ Scanner. In this guide, we would like to introduce some more advanced implementations of the library to give you a full view of the type of applications that you can build.

## Hello World

As mentioned previously, this is the most rudimentary and basic implementation of the MRZ Scanner that uses the default UI and settings of the MRZ Scanner.

The full code of Hello World can be found [**here**](helloworld/index.md).

## Demo

The demo implementation adds a bit more colour and character to the Hello World implementation, and in turn helping you create a presentable and friendly design for your MRZ scanning application!

The full code of the Demo can be found [**here**](demo/index.md).
