# MRZ Scanner JavaScript Edition - Code Gallery

In the user guide, we helped walk you through the Hello World implementation which is the most basic implementation that uses the default UI of the MRZ Scanner. In this guide, we would like to introduce some more advanced implementations of the library to give you a full view of the type of applications that you can build.

## Hello World

As mentioned previously, this is the most rudimentary and basic implementation of the MRZ Scanner that uses the default UI and settings of the MRZ Scanner.

The full code of Hello World can be found [**here**](helloworld/index.md).

## Demo

The demo implementation adds a bit more colour and character to the Hello World implementation, and in turn helping you create a presentable and friendly design for your MRZ scanning application!

The full code of the Demo can be found [**here**](demo/index.md).

## Dynamic Web TWAIN integration with MRZ

There could be some cases where the use of a camera is not the target input source. In this sample, we explore the integration of the MRZ Scanner with one of Dynamsoft's star products, Dynamic Web TWAIN (DWT for short). DWT is mainly used to acquire images from a physical scanner or loading/downloading images. Using Dynamsoft Capture Vision's foundational API, we demonstrate how you can integrate MRZ reading capabilities into a DWT application.

The full code and breakdown can be found [**here**](dwt-mrz/index.md).
