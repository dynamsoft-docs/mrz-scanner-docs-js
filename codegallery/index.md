# MRZ Scanner JavaScript Edition - Code Gallery

In the user guide, we helped walk you through the Hello World implementation which is the most basic implementation that uses the default UI of the MRZ Scanner. In this guide, we would like to introduce some more advanced implementations of the library to give you a full view of the type of applications that you can build.

## Hello World

As mentioned previously, this is the most rudimentary and basic implementation of the MRZ Scanner that uses the default UI and settings of the MRZ Scanner.

The full code of Hello World can be found [**here**](helloworld/index.md).

## Frameworks

The Dynamsoft team has worked to create samples with the main web development frameworks that we have used for all of our browser-based products. These frameworks are **React**, **Angular**, and **Vue**. The samples are hosted on Github and we recommend using them as reference if you are looking to build a web application using the MRZ Scanner and one of these frameworks.

If you come across any web development frameworks that you want to use with the MRZ Scanner, please let the Dynamsoft team know to see if it is feasible to come up with a sample for that framework.

### React

In this sample, a Hello World implementation is done with the [React](https://react.dev/) framework.

Please find the full code of this sample [**here**](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/mrz-scanner-javascript/tree/main/samples/frameworks/react-hooks).

### Angular

In this sample, a Hello World implementation is done with the [Angular](https://angular.dev/) framework.

Please find the full code of this sample [**here**](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/mrz-scanner-javascript/tree/main/samples/frameworks/angular).

### Vue

In this sample, a Hello World implementation is done with the [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) framework.

Please find the full code of this sample [**here**](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/mrz-scanner-javascript/tree/main/samples/frameworks/vue).

## Demo

The demo implementation adds a bit more colour and character to the Hello World implementation, and in turn helping you create a presentable and friendly design for your MRZ scanning application!

The full code of the Demo can be found [**here**](demo/index.md).
