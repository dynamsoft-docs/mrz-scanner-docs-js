# Introduction 
In today's world of constant travel and activities that require identity verification, it is important to have the tools necessary in order to quickly and accurately capture and recognize all of that personal information in one go. Most travel and identity documents today come with a *Machine Readable Zone* (MRZ for short) that stores and encrypts all of the information of that identity document in just a few lines.

When it comes to reading MRZ documents, it is important to find a library that not only recognizes the MRZ lines, but also then parses them into human readable fields for the user. With the **MRZ Scanner JavaScript Edition**, there is no better library to help you achieve that for any kind of web application you are building, all with just a few lines of code!
